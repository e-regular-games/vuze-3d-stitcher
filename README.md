# vuze-3d-stitcher
A python based script for combining 8 separate photos taken by the Vuze 4K 3D 360 camera into a stereo 360 image. The goal is to provide a unix based alternative to the Vuze VR Studio which is only available on Windows and MAC. In the process, it may be possible to improve upon the overall stitch and output image quality.
